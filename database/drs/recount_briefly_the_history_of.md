# Solution
**Correct Answer:** The history of man-made networks spans from physical transport infrastructures (roads, aqueducts) to electromagnetic signaling (telegraph, telephone) and modern packet-switched data networks (Internet).

## Explanation
The history of man-made networks is a progression from the movement of physical matter to the transmission of information at the speed of light. Initially, networks were localized and purely physical. In antiquity, the Roman Empire developed an extensive road network, a precursor to modern transit systems, which allowed for the centralized control of a vast geographical area. This was followed by hydraulic networks, such as aqueducts, designed for resource distribution.

The industrial revolution triggered a massive expansion in network complexity through the development of canal systems and, subsequently, the railway. These networks were the first to demonstrate complex logistical constraints and the need for scheduling and synchronization. However, the most significant shift in "network dynamics" occurred in the 19th century with the invention of the electric telegraph. This decoupled the speed of information from the speed of physical travel.

In the 20th century, the telephone network introduced the concept of "circuit switching," where a dedicated physical path was required for communication. This evolved into the power grid—perhaps the most complex machine ever built—requiring real-time stability and control across thousands of nodes. Finally, the late 20th century saw the rise of the Internet, based on "packet switching," where data is fragmented and routed dynamically. Modern networks are now characterized by their "scale-free" nature and a high degree of interdependence between physical and cyber layers.

### Steps / Derivation
1. **Physical Era:** Focus on transport and resource distribution (Roads $\rightarrow$ Canals $\rightarrow$ Railways).
2. **Electromagnetic Era:** The decoupling of message and messenger via the Telegraph and Telephone.
3. **Power Era:** The development of interconnected electrical grids requiring synchronous control.
4. **Digital Era:** The transition to packet-switched data networks and the modern Internet topology.
