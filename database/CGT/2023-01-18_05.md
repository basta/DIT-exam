# Question
(a) (2 pts) Does every weighted voting game have a nonempty core? [cite: 562]
(b) (2 pts) Is the Banzhaf index of a non-veto player always nonzero? [cite: 563]
(c) (3 pts) Find a 5-player weighted voting game with precisely 1 vetoer and 1 null player. [cite: 564]
(d) (3 pts) Show that the core of game $v$ ($N=\{1, 2, 3\}$; $v(1)=v(2)=v(13)=1, v(3)=0, v(12)=v(23)=2, v(123)=3$) is a line segment in $\mathbb{R}^3$. [cite: 565, 566, 567]

# Solution

## (a) Core Non-emptiness
**No.** A counterexample is pure majority voting ($n=3$, weights $(1,1,1)$, quota $q=2$). [cite: 569]

## (b) Banzhaf Index of Non-vetoers
**No.** A null player is not a vetoer, yet their Banzhaf index is zero. [cite: 570]

## (c) Specific Voting Game
An example is a game with weights $(3, 1, 1, 1, 0)$ and quota $4$. (Player 1 is the vetoer; Player 5 is a null player). [cite: 571]

## (d) Core Geometry
The game $v$ is **supermodular**. [cite: 572] Its core is the convex hull of its marginal vectors. In this case, there are only two distinct marginal vectors: **$(1, 1, 1)$** and **$(1, 2, 0)$**. [cite: 572, 573] The convex hull of two points is a line segment.
