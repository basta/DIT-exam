# Question
(5 pts) An Engineer has low ($t=1$) or high ($t=2$) talent (equal probability $1/2$). Talent is private information. [cite: 487, 488]
* **Engineer's Actions:** Apply for Job or do a Startup. [cite: 489]
* **Company's Actions:** Hire or Not Hire. [cite: 490]
If the Company does not hire an applicant, the Engineer does a Startup. [cite: 491]
* **Payoffs:** Engineer gets $t$ from Startup and $w$ (wage) from Job. Company gets $t-w$ from hiring, 0 otherwise. [cite: 492, 493]

(a) What is the Engineer's best strategy based on $t$ and $w$? [cite: 522]
(b) What is the Company's best strategy based on $w$? [cite: 523]
(c) For which value(s) of $w$ does a non-pure mixed Bayes-Nash equilibrium exist? [cite: 524]

# Solution

## (a) Engineer's Best Strategy
* **Low Talent ($t=1$):** Startup if $w < 1$; Job if $w > 1$; any mixture if $w=1$. [cite: 527, 528, 529, 530]
* **High Talent ($t=2$):** Startup if $w < 2$; Job if $w > 2$; any mixture if $w=2$. [cite: 531, 532, 533, 534]

## (b) Company's Best Strategy
The Company considers the expected utility given the Engineer's type:
* **$w < 1$:** Hire. [cite: 537]
* **$w = 1$:** Any mixture. [cite: 538]
* **$w > 1$:** Not Hire. (If $1 < w < 2$, only low talent applies, leading to a loss; if $w > 2$, both apply but the loss remains). [cite: 539, 541]

## (c) Mixed Bayes-Nash Equilibrium Existence
* **For $w \le 1$:** Both types choose Startup; any Company mixture is a best response. [cite: 542]
* **For $w > 1$:** The Company chooses Not Hire; any mixture of Engineer actions (for both talents) is a best response. [cite: 543]
