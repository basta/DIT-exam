# Question
(10p) Consider a two-player zero-sum game where the payoff of the row player is given by the matrix
$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 2 & 0 & 3 \\ -1 & 3 & -3 \end{bmatrix}$$

(a) (2 pts) Write the formula for the expected payoff of the column player when the row player uses the uniform distribution on all the strategies and the column player plays a generic mixed strategy $q$.

(b) (2 pts) Does this game have a pure Nash equilibrium? Why?

(c) (3 pts) Verify that the mixed strategy for the row player $(0, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3})$ and the mixed strategy for the column player $(\frac{1}{5}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{1}{5})$ form a Nash equilibrium.

(d) (3 pts) Write the linear programs for computing the maximin and minimax strategies.

# Solution

## (a) Expected Payoff for Column Player
In a zero-sum game, the payoff matrix for the column player is $-A$:
$$-A = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & -1 & 0 \\ -2 & 0 & -3 \\ 1 & -3 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$$
The row player uses a uniform distribution $p = (\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3})$. Given a column player's mixed strategy $q = (q_1, q_2, q_3)$, the expected payoff is:
$$E = p^T(-A)q = \frac{1}{3} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -2 & -1 & 0 \\ -2 & 0 & -3 \\ 1 & -3 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} q_1 \\ q_2 \\ q_3 \end{bmatrix}$$
$$E = \frac{1}{3} [(-2-2+1)q_1 + (-1+0-3)q_2 + (0-3+3)q_3]$$
$$E = \frac{1}{3}(-3q_1 - 4q_2) = -q_1 - \frac{4}{3}q_2$$

## (b) Pure Nash Equilibrium
No. A pure Nash equilibrium exists if and only if the matrix has a **saddle point** (where an entry is the minimum of its row and the maximum of its column). 
- Row mins: $\{0, 0, -3\}$. Max of mins = 0.
- Col maxs: $\{2, 3, 3\}$. Min of maxs = 2.
Since $0 \neq 2$, there is no saddle point and thus no pure Nash equilibrium.

## (c) Verification of Mixed NE
To verify the equilibrium, we check if the strategies are best responses to each other.
- **Row player payoff** with $q = (\frac{1}{5}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{1}{5})$:
    - Row 1: $2(\frac{1}{5}) + 1(\frac{3}{5}) + 0 = 1$
    - Row 2: $2(\frac{1}{5}) + 0 + 3(\frac{1}{5}) = 1$
    - Row 3: $-1(\frac{1}{5}) + 3(\frac{3}{5}) - 3(\frac{1}{5}) = 1$
    The value is $1$ for all rows. The row player's strategy $(0, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3})$ is a best response because any mixture of rows 2 and 3 yields $1$.

- **Column player payoff** (using $-A$) with $p = (0, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3})$:
    - Col 1: $-2(\frac{2}{3}) + 1(\frac{1}{3}) = -1$
    - Col 2: $0(\frac{2}{3}) - 3(\frac{1}{3}) = -1$
    - Col 3: $-3(\frac{2}{3}) + 3(\frac{1}{3}) = -1$
    The value is $-1$ for all columns. The column player's strategy $(\frac{1}{5}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{1}{5})$ is a best response.

## (d) Linear Programs
**Maximin strategy for Row Player (find $p_i, v_1$):**
Maximize $v_1$ subject to:
$$2p_1 + 2p_2 - p_3 \ge v_1$$
$$p_1 + 3p_3 \ge v_1$$
$$3p_2 - 3p_3 \ge v_1$$
$$p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1, \quad p_i \ge 0, \quad v_1 \in \mathbb{R}$$

**Minimax strategy for Column Player (find $q_i, v_2$):**
Minimize $v_2$ subject to:
$$2q_1 + q_2 \le v_2$$
$$2q_1 + 3q_3 \le v_2$$
$$-q_1 + 3q_2 - 3q_3 \le v_2$$
$$q_1 + q_2 + q_3 = 1, \quad q_i \ge 0, \quad v_2 \in \mathbb{R}$$
