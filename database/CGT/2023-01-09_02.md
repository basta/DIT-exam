# Question
(a) (2 pts) Consider a two-player zero-sum game with perfect recall, where both players have $I$ infosets and $A$ actions in each infoset. [cite: 350] What is the number of variables and constraints of the sequence-form linear program for the first player? [cite: 351]

(b) (3 pts) Can any extensive-form game be transformed into a normal-form game? Describe the transformation or provide a counterexample. [cite: 352, 353]

(c) (5 pts) Consider a card game: Both players bet 1 chip. A deck of 5 cards (two Js, two Qs, one K) is used. [cite: 357, 358] Player 1 sees their card and chooses to Bet or Fold. [cite: 359] If Player 1 bets, Player 2 chooses to Bet or Fold. [cite: 360] Higher card wins; same value results in a tie. [cite: 361, 363] Write down all sequences and pure strategies for Player 2. [cite: 364]

# Solution

## (a) Sequence-Form Complexity
* **Variables:** $IA + I + 1$. [cite: 367]
    * Each sequence (action in each infoset) plus the empty sequence: $IA + 1$. [cite: 366]
    * Each opponent infoset: $I$. [cite: 366]
* **Constraints:** $IA + IA + I$. [cite: 369]
    * Constraints for opponent's actions/infosets: $IA$. [cite: 367]
    * Realization plans must be $\ge 0$: $IA$. [cite: 368]
    * Conservation of flow (Realization plan leading into an infoset = sum of plans leading out): $I$. [cite: 369]

## (b) Transformation to Normal-Form
**Yes.** [cite: 370] The procedure involves:
1. Listing all pure strategies for each player. [cite: 370]
2. Calculating utility for each combination of pure strategies as the weighted sum of terminal node payoffs (weighted by chance node probabilities). [cite: 371]

## (c) Player 2 Sequences and Strategies
**Sequences ($\Sigma_2$):** $\{ \emptyset, \text{Fold}_j, \text{Fold}_q, \text{Fold}_k, \text{Bet}_j, \text{Bet}_q, \text{Bet}_k \}$. [cite: 372]
**Pure Strategies ($S_2$):** [cite: 373]
* $\{\text{Fold}_j, \text{Fold}_q, \text{Fold}_k\}$
* $\{\text{Fold}_j, \text{Fold}_q, \text{Bet}_k\}$
* $\{\text{Fold}_j, \text{Bet}_q, \text{Fold}_k\}$
* $\{\text{Fold}_j, \text{Bet}_q, \text{Bet}_k\}$
* $\{\text{Bet}_j, \text{Fold}_q, \text{Fold}_k\}$
* $\{\text{Bet}_j, \text{Fold}_q, \text{Bet}_k\}$
* $\{\text{Bet}_j, \text{Bet}_q, \text{Fold}_k\}$
* $\{\text{Bet}_j, \text{Bet}_q, \text{Bet}_k\}$
