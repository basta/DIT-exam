# Question
(10p) A Parliament has 100 seats: Alpha (10), Beta (25), Gamma (30), Delta (35). A law passes if it gets $\ge 51$ votes AND at least Alpha or Beta votes in favor. [cite: 289, 290, 291, 292]

(a) (2 pts) List the minimal winning coalitions. [cite: 293]
(b) (3 pts) Can this be represented as a weighted voting game? Provide weights and quota if yes. [cite: 294]
(c) (2 pts) Compute the Shapley-Shubik index for each party. [cite: 295]
(d) (2 pts) Compute the normalized Banzhaf index for each party. [cite: 296]
(e) (1 pts) Is there a veto party? [cite: 297]

# Solution

## (a) Minimal Winning Coalitions
The minimal winning coalitions are: $\{Beta, Gamma\}$, $\{Beta, Delta\}$, and $\{Alpha, Gamma, Delta\}$. [cite: 299]

## (b) Weighted Representation
Yes. One possible representation uses weights $w = (1, 5, 4, 4)$ with a quota $q = 9$. [cite: 299]

## (c) Shapley-Shubik Index
The index is $\frac{1}{24}(2, 10, 6, 6)$, which simplifies to $(\frac{1}{12}, \frac{5}{12}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4})$. [cite: 300]

## (d) Normalized Banzhaf Index
In this specific game, the normalized Banzhaf index is equal to the Shapley-Shubik index: $(\frac{1}{12}, \frac{5}{12}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4})$. [cite: 300]

## (e) Veto Party
No. A veto party must be present in every minimal winning coalition. [cite: 297] In this game, no single party belongs to all winning coalitions. [cite: 300]
