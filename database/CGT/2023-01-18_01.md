# Question
(10p) Consider the two-player strategic game with the utility bimatrix:
$$\begin{bmatrix} (3,5) & (0,0) \\ (0,0) & (5,3) \end{bmatrix}$$
The strategy sets are $S_1 = \{a, b\}$ (row player) and $S_2 = \{c, d\}$ (column player). [cite: 451, 452, 454]

(a) (1 pts) Explain why this game has at least one Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies. [cite: 455]

(b) (4 pts) Find a strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE) where the row player is the leader. [cite: 456]

(c) (5 pts) Find at least one correlated equilibrium. [cite: 457]

# Solution

## (a) Existence of Nash Equilibrium
By **Nash's Theorem**, every finite strategic game has at least one Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies. [cite: 459]

## (b) Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium
Let $p$ be the probability that the leader (row player) plays strategy $a$. [cite: 460] We evaluate two cases based on the follower's best response:
1. **Follower plays $c$:** Maximize $3p$ subject to $5p \ge 3(1-p)$ and $0 \le p \le 1$. [cite: 461]
2. **Follower plays $d$:** Maximize $5(1-p)$ subject to $3(1-p) \ge 5p$ and $0 \le p \le 1$. [cite: 461, 462]

The optimal value for the second LP is 5 (at $p=0$). [cite: 462] Thus, the SSE is the pure strategy profile **$(b, d)$**. [cite: 462]

## (c) Correlated Equilibrium
The set of correlated equilibria is a convex polytope defined by linear inequalities ensuring no player has an incentive to deviate given their signal. [cite: 463]
The inequalities for this game are:
* $5p(a,d) \le 3p(a,c)$
* $3p(b,c) \le 5p(b,d)$
* $3p(b,c) \le 5p(a,c)$
* $5p(a,d) \le 3p(b,d)$ [cite: 463]

One such equilibrium is $p(a,c) = t$, $p(b,d) = 1-t$, and $p(a,d) = p(b,c) = 0$ for $t \in [0,1]$. [cite: 463]
