# Question
(6 pts) Find the unique mixed Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Player $a_2$ has types $a_2^l$ (75%) and $a_2^r$ (25%) and actions L, M, R. Player $a_1$ has actions U, D.

**Payoffs ($a_2^l$ - 75%):**
| | L | M | R |
|---|---|---|---|
| **U** | 0, 1 | 4, 0 | 4, 0 |
| **D** | 4, 2 | 0, 1 | 0, 8 |

**Payoffs ($a_2^r$ - 25%):**
| | L | M | R |
|---|---|---|---|
| **U** | 8, 0 | 0, 4 | 4, 3 |
| **D** | 0, 3 | 8, 2 | 3, 1 |

# Solution
The unique equilibrium strategies are:
* **Player 1 ($a_1$):** Plays a specific mixed strategy $[\dots]$.
* **Player 2 ($a_2$):** * Type $a_2^l$ plays $[0, \dots, 0]$ (specific distribution).
    * Type $a_2^r$ plays $[0, 1, 0]$ (Pure strategy M).
