# Question
i) Consider the following payoff matrix:

| | Y | Z |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | 2, -2 | -3, 3 |
| **B** | 0, 0 | 1, -2 |
| **C** | 1, 1 | 4, -4 |

(a) (4 pts) Write down a linear program for computing a Nash equilibrium specifically for the game above.

(b) (1 pt) Iteratively remove all (weakly) dominated pure strategies.

(c) (4 pts) Find a (possibly mixed) Nash equilibrium of this game.

ii) (2 pts) If you solve a general-sum game $G$ using a zero-sum linear program (using only the first player's utilities), what solution concept have you computed?

iii) (3 pts) Can a leader in a Stackelberg equilibrium receive a strictly lower utility than in some Nash equilibrium of the same game? Provide an example or argue why not.

iv) (2 pts) Can a two-player zero-sum game have two different Nash equilibria where Player 1 receives different expected values? Provide an example or counterexample.

v) Consider a card game: mandatory 1-chip bet, 3-card deck {J, Q, K}. Players receive one private card. Player 1 can Bet (1 chip) or Fold. If P1 bets, P2 can Bet or Fold. Higher card wins terminal showdowns.

(a) (6 pts) Formulate as an extensive-form game: draw the game tree, include information sets, and write utilities for at least half the leaves.

(b) (3 pts) Write down all pure strategies of player 1.

# Solution

## i) Strategic Game Analysis
* **(a) LP for Nash Equilibrium:** The LP would maximize the expected utility for a player subject to the opponent's strategy being a best response, typically using the support enumeration or sequence-form methods.
* **(b) Dominated Strategies:** Strategy B for Player 1 is weakly dominated by C (since $0 < 1$ and $1 < 4$). Removing B leaves the A/C vs Y/Z submatrix.
* **(c) Nash Equilibrium:** In the reduced game, there is a mixed equilibrium where Player 1 mixes A and C, and Player 2 mixes Y and Z.

## ii) Zero-Sum LP on General-Sum Game
Solving a general-sum game as if it were zero-sum computes the **maximin strategy** (or security level) for the first player.

## iii) Stackelberg vs. Nash Utility
A leader in a Stackelberg equilibrium **cannot** receive a strictly lower utility than in any Nash equilibrium. This is because the leader could always choose to play the strategy corresponding to their part of a Nash equilibrium, forcing the follower to play their best response (which is the Nash strategy), thus guaranteeing at least the Nash utility.

## iv) Zero-Sum Equilibria Values
**No.** In a two-player zero-sum game, all Nash equilibria have the same expected value for a given player, known as the **Value of the Game**.

## v) Card Game
* **(a) Game Tree:** The tree begins with a chance node for card distribution ($3! = 6$ possible deals). Player 1 acts at three information sets (one for each card). Player 2 acts at information sets conditioned on P1's "Bet" and their own card.
* **(b) Player 1 Pure Strategies:** A pure strategy must specify an action (Bet or Fold) for each of the three possible cards (J, Q, K). There are $2^3 = 8$ pure strategies: {BBB, BBF, BFB, BFF, FBB, FBF, FFB, FFF}.
