# Question
(a) (4 pts) In coalitional game $v$, for player $i$: $v(A \cup \{i\}) \ge v(A) + v(i)$ for all $A \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}$. Prove the Shapley value $\phi_i \ge v(i)$. [cite: 132, 133]

(b) (3 pts) A 4-player simple game: winning coalitions are $\{1, 2\}$, $\{1, 3\}$, and their supersets. Identify null players, dictators, and vetoers; compute Banzhaf indices. [cite: 134, 135]

(c) (1 pts) Game $v$ with $N=\{1, 2, 3\}$: $v(i)=1$, $v(12)=v(23)=2$, $v(13)=3$, $v(N)=5$. Is $v$ supermodular? [cite: 136, 137]

(d) (2 pts) Is the core of $v$ in (c) non-empty? Find a core element. [cite: 138]

# Solution

## (a) Shapley Value Proof
The Shapley value is defined as: [cite: 144]
$$\phi_i(v) = \sum_{i \notin A \subseteq N} \frac{|A|!(n-|A|-1)!}{n!} (v(A \cup \{i\}) - v(A))$$
Since $v(A \cup \{i\}) - v(A) \ge v(i)$ for all $A$, and the sum of weights is 1, it follows that $\phi_i(v) \ge v(i) \sum \text{weights} = v(i)$[cite: 144].

## (b) Simple Game Roles and Banzhaf
* **Dictator:** None[cite: 145].
* **Vetoer:** Player 1[cite: 145].
* **Null Player:** Player 4[cite: 145].
* **Banzhaf Index:** $( \dots, 0)$ (Player 4 has 0 power)[cite: 146].

## (c) Supermodularity
The game is supermodular[cite: 146].

## (d) Non-empty Core
Yes. Due to supermodularity, any marginal vector is in the core[cite: 147].
**Example element:** $(1, 1, 3)$ (associated with identity permutation)[cite: 148].
