# Question
(10p) Four shareholders have weights $w = (40, 30, 20, 10)$. A proposal passes if the total share is $\ge 51$.

(a) (3 pts) Model this as a simple voting game.
(b) (3 pts) Compute the Banzhaf index.
(c) (2 pts) Is this game supermodular?
(d) (2 pts) Does the game have a non-empty core?

# Solution

## (a) Simple Voting Game Model
$v(A) = 1$ if $\sum_{i \in A} w_i \ge 51$, and $v(A) = 0$ otherwise, for any coalition $A \subseteq \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$.

## (b) Banzhaf Index
The Banzhaf index for the shareholders is $(\frac{5}{8}, \frac{3}{8}, \frac{3}{8}, \frac{1}{8})$.

## (c) Supermodularity
No. A counterexample is $v(123) + v(1) \le v(12) + v(13)$. Since $1 + 0 \le 1 + 1$ (where $1 \le 2$), the condition for supermodularity is violated.

## (d) Core
The core is **empty** because the game has no veto players.
