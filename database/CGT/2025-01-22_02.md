# Question
(a) (2 pts) Consider a game where Player 1 offers Player 2 a number (1-6). Player 2 accepts (termination) or declines (Player 1 chooses again). This repeats until acceptance. Can this be modeled as an extensive-form game? Provide the tree or explain why not. [cite: 111, 112, 113]

(b) (5 pts) Imagine a 3-player game with perfect recall. Order: $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$. Each player has $A$ actions, played for $D$ turns. Each player observes the action played immediately before them. 
1. What is the total number of histories and infosets for each player? [cite: 117, 118, 119]
2. How do these change with imperfect recall (only observing the last action)? [cite: 120]

(c) (3 pts) Imagine a two-round Rock-Paper-Scissors where results are not revealed until the end. Write the sequences and pure strategies of Player 1. [cite: 121, 122]

# Solution

## (a) Finite Representation
No, it cannot be modeled as a standard extensive-form game tree because the game is potentially infinite[cite: 124].

## (b) Complexity Analysis
* **Histories:** The game starts with a single history. Each turn, players choose from $A$ actions for $3D$ total turns. $|H| = 1 + A + A^2 + \dots + A^{3D} = \sum_{i=0}^{3D} A^i$[cite: 125]. This is the same for imperfect recall[cite: 126].
* **Infosets (Perfect Recall):**
    * $|I_1| = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} A^{2i}$[cite: 128].
    * $|I_2| = |I_3| = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} A^{2i+1}$[cite: 128].
* **Infosets (Imperfect Recall):** Each player only sees the last action.
    * $|I_1| = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{D-1} A$[cite: 128].
    * $|I_2| = |I_3| = \sum_{i=1}^{D} A$[cite: 128].

## (c) RPS Sequences and Strategies
* **Sequences ($\Sigma_1$):** $\{\emptyset\} \cup \{R, P, S\} \cup \{ij \mid i, j \in \{R, P, S\}\}$[cite: 129].
* **Pure Strategies ($S_1$):** $\{iRjPkSl \mid i, j, k, l \in \{R, P, S\}\}$, where $i$ is the first round choice, and $Rj, Pk, Sl$ represent the second round response if the first round was Rock, Paper, or Scissors respectively[cite: 130, 131].
