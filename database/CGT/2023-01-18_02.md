# Question
(a) (2 pts) What is a behavioral strategy and what is a realization plan? Provide the formulas to extract one from the other. [cite: 464, 465]

(b) (3 pts) Consider a two-player zero-sum game with perfect recall and no chance elements. Players take turns, each having exactly $A$ actions per node. The game terminates after both players play $d$ actions. What are the minimum and maximum possible amounts of information sets? [cite: 466, 467, 468]

(c) (5 pts) Consider a card game: 6 cards (two Js, one Q, two Ks, one A). Both players bet 1 chip; each receives one private card. Player 1 chooses to Bet or Fold; if Player 1 bets, Player 2 chooses to Bet or Fold. Higher card wins; ties split the pot. List the variables for the sequence-form LP to find Player 2's part of the Nash equilibrium. [cite: 469, 470, 471, 472, 473, 477, 478, 479]

# Solution

## (a) Strategies and Plans
* **Realization Plan ($r(\sigma)$):** The probability that a specific sequence of actions $\sigma$ is played. [cite: 481]
* **Behavioral Strategy ($\pi(I, a)$):** The probability of playing action $a$ in information set $I$. [cite: 482]
* **Extraction:** For a sequence $\sigma$ leading to $I$, the behavioral strategy is: $\pi(I, a) = \frac{r(\sigma a)}{r(\sigma)}$. [cite: 482]

## (b) Information Set Bounds
* **Minimum Infosets:** Occurs when players only remember their own past actions. This results in $2 \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} A^i$ total information sets ($1 + A + \dots + A^{d-1}$ per player). [cite: 483, 484, 485]
* **Maximum Infosets:** Occurs in a game of perfect information. The number of information sets equals the number of histories: $\sum_{i=0}^{2d-1} A^i$. [cite: 485]

## (c) Sequence-Form LP Variables
The variables include realization plans for each sequence and dual variables for opponent information sets: [cite: 486]
* **Player 2 Sequences:** $r(\emptyset), r(Fold_J), r(Fold_Q), r(Fold_K), r(Fold_A), r(Bet_J), r(Bet_Q), r(Bet_K), r(Bet_A)$. [cite: 486]
* **Opponent Infosets (Dual Variables):** $v(I_J), v(I_Q), v(I_K), v(I_A)$. [cite: 486]
