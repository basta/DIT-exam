# Question
(5 pts) Find the unique mixed Bayes-Nash equilibrium and payoffs. Player 1 (row) has one type. Player 2 has two equally likely types $t$ and $t'$. [cite: 301, 302, 303]

**Payoffs (Type $t$):**
| | L | R |
|---|---|---|
| **U** | 4, 3 | 0, 1 |
| **D** | 1, 1 | 3, 3 |

**Payoffs (Type $t'$):**
| | L | R |
|---|---|---|
| **U** | 1, 0 | 2, 2 |
| **D** | 0, 1 | 1, 2 |

# Solution
The unique mixed Bayes-Nash equilibrium is:
- **Player 1 Strategy:** $p(U) = \frac{1}{2}$ [cite: 316]
- **Player 2 Type $t$:** $q_t(L) = \frac{1}{3}$ [cite: 316]
- **Player 2 Type $t'$:** $q_{t'}(L) = 0$ [cite: 316]

**Payoffs:**
- **Player 1 (ex ante expected):** $\frac{5}{3}$ [cite: 316, 318]
- **Player 2 (each type):** 2 [cite: 317]
