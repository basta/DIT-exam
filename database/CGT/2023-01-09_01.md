# Question
(a) (2 pts) Is the following assertion true or not? "Every 2-player strategic game with strategy spaces of size 2 each has a Nash equilibrium in which one player uses a pure strategy." [cite: 335, 336]

(b) (3 pts) Formulate a linear program to compute the equilibrium strategy of the maximizing (row) player in a matrix game (referencing the provided matrix context). [cite: 337]

(c) (5 pts) Formulate an optimization problem to maximize the social welfare of correlated equilibria in a two-player game with the following payoffs: [cite: 339]
$$\begin{bmatrix} (1,1) & (2,3) \\ (0,1) & (3,2) \end{bmatrix}$$
Decide if the problem has an optimal solution. [cite: 340, 341]

# Solution

## (a) Assertion Verification
**False.** [cite: 343] The standard counterexample is **Matching Pennies**, where the only Nash equilibrium is in mixed strategies $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ for both players. [cite: 343]

## (b) Linear Program Formulation
Maximize $v$ subject to: [cite: 343, 344]
* $2p + (1-p) \ge v$ [cite: 344]
* $-4p + 3(1-p) \ge v$ [cite: 344]
* $1 \ge p \ge 0$ [cite: 343]
* $v \in \mathbb{R}$ [cite: 344]

## (c) Social Welfare of Correlated Equilibria
Maximize Social Welfare: [cite: 344]
$$\sum_{i=1,2} \sum_{s \in \{1,2\}^2} p(s) u_i(s)$$ [cite: 345]
Subject to:
1. **Probability constraints:** $p(s) \ge 0$ for all $s$, and $\sum p(s) = 1$. [cite: 346]
2. **Player 1 Incentive Constraints:**
   * $0p(1,1) + 3p(1,2) \le 1p(1,1) + 2p(1,2)$ [cite: 347]
   * $1p(2,1) + 2p(2,2) \le 0p(2,1) + 3p(2,2)$ [cite: 348]
3. **Player 2 Incentive Constraints:**
   * $2p(1,1) + 3p(2,1) \le 1p(1,1) + 1p(2,1)$ [cite: 349]
   * $1p(1,2) + 1p(2,2) \le 3p(1,2) + 2p(2,2)$ [cite: 349]

The problem has an optimal solution because the set of correlated equilibria is a convex polytope and the objective function is linear. [cite: 341, 346]
