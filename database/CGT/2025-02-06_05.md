# Question
(4 pts) What is the result of a VCG auction with three bidders ($b_1, b_2, b_3$) and two items (A and B)?

| Bidder | Item A | Item B | Bundle AB |
|---|---|---|---|
| $b_1$ | 6 | 6 | 9 |
| $b_2$ | 7 | 3 | 10 |
| $b_3$ | 9 | 3 | 13 |

Decide who wins which items and their payments.

# Solution

## 1. Allocation (Maximizing Social Welfare)
We test possible allocations:
* $b_1 \to AB$: Welfare = 9.
* $b_2 \to AB$: Welfare = 10.
* $b_3 \to AB$: Welfare = 13.
* $b_3 \to A, b_1 \to B$: Welfare = 9 + 6 = **15**.
* $b_3 \to A, b_2 \to B$: Welfare = 9 + 3 = 12.
* $b_2 \to A, b_1 \to B$: Welfare = 7 + 6 = 13.

**Result:** Bidder 3 wins Item A, Bidder 1 wins Item B. Total Welfare = 15.

## 2. Payments
The payment for bidder $i$ is $(W_{-i} \text{ without } i) - (W \text{ of others with } i)$.
* **Bidder 1 Payment (for B):**
    * Welfare without $b_1$: Max is $b_3 \to AB$ (13).
    * Welfare of others with $b_1$: $b_3$ wins A (9).
    * Payment = $13 - 9 = 4$.
* **Bidder 3 Payment (for A):**
    * Welfare without $b_3$: Max is $b_2 \to A, b_1 \to B$ (13).
    * Welfare of others with $b_3$: $b_1$ wins B (6).
    * Payment = $13 - 6 = 7$.

**Final Result:** Bidder 1 wins Item B (pays 4), Bidder 3 wins Item A (pays 7).
