# Question
(10p) Consider a two-player zero-sum game where the payoff of the row player is given by the matrix
$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

(a) (2 pts) Write the formula for the expected payoff of the column player when the row player uses the uniform distribution on all strategies and the column player plays a generic mixed strategy $q=(q_1, q_2, q_3)$. [cite: 246, 247, 248]

(b) (2 pts) Does this game have a pure Nash equilibrium? Briefly justify your answer. [cite: 249]

(c) (3 pts) Verify that the mixed strategy $p=(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$ for the row player and the mixed strategy $q=(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2})$ for the column player form a Nash equilibrium. [cite: 250]

(d) (3 pts) Write the linear programs for computing the maximin strategy of the row player and the minimax strategy of the column player. [cite: 251]

# Solution

## (a) Expected Payoff for Column Player
The expected payoff of the column player is $-\frac{1}{3}(4q_1 + 2q_2 + 2q_3) = -\frac{2}{3}(q_1 + 1)$. [cite: 253, 254]

## (b) Pure Nash Equilibrium
No. The matrix has no saddle point, as the maximin value ($0$) is strictly less than the minimax value ($1$). [cite: 255]

## (c) Nash Equilibrium Verification
- **Against $q$:** The expected row payoffs are $1$, $1$, and $\frac{1}{2}$ respectively. [cite: 255] Since the highest payoff is $1$, rows 1 and 2 are best responses. [cite: 256]
- **Against $p$:** Each column yields the same expected payoff of $1$ to the row player. [cite: 256]
- **Conclusion:** In both cases, the strategies in the support are among the best responses, implying that $(p, q)$ is a Nash equilibrium. [cite: 257, 258]

## (d) Linear Programs
**Maximin Strategy (Row Player):**
Maximize $v$ subject to:
* $3p_1 - p_2 + 2p_3 \ge v$ [cite: 259]
* $p_1 + p_2 \ge v$ [cite: 259]
* $2p_3$ (Correction: $2p_2 \ge v$ based on matrix Col 3) [cite: 247, 259]
* $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$ [cite: 259]
* $p_1, p_2, p_3 \ge 0, v \in \mathbb{R}$ [cite: 259]

**Minimax Strategy (Column Player):**
Minimize $v$ subject to:
* $3q_1 + q_2 \le v$ [cite: 260]
* $-q_1 + q_2 + 2q_3 \le v$ [cite: 260]
* $2q_1 \le v$ [cite: 260]
* $q_1 + q_2 + q_3 = 1$ [cite: 260]
* $q_1, q_2, q_3 \ge 0, v \in \mathbb{R}$ [cite: 260]
