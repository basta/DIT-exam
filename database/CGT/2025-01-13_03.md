# Question
(10p) A Parliament has 100 seats. MPs are either civil or military. Four parties exist[cite: 50, 51, 52]:
- **Red:** 11 MPs (5 military) [cite: 53]
- **Green:** 17 MPs (0 military) [cite: 54]
- **Blue:** 42 MPs (15 military) [cite: 55]
- **White:** 30 MPs (20 military) [cite: 56]

A law passes if it gets $\ge 51$ total votes AND $\ge 21$ military votes[cite: 60, 61].

(a) (2 pts) Represent this as a vector weighted voting game[cite: 62].
(b) (3 pts) Can it be represented as a single weighted voting game? [cite: 63]
(c) (2 pts) Compute the Shapley-Shubik index for each party[cite: 64].
(d) (2 pts) Compute the Banzhaf index for each party[cite: 65].
(e) (1 pts) Is there a veto party? [cite: 66]

# Solution

## (a) Vector Weighted Voting Game
The game is the intersection of two weights:
- Total votes: $w^1 = (11, 17, 42, 30)$, quota $q^1 = 51$[cite: 68].
- Military votes: $w^2 = (5, 0, 15, 20)$, quota $q^2 = 21$[cite: 68].

## (b) Single Weighted Representation
Yes, it can be simplified[cite: 68]. An example representation is $w = (1, 1, 2, 3)$ with quota $q = 5$[cite: 68].

## (c) Shapley-Shubik Index
The calculated index for the parties (Red, Green, Blue, White) is: $(2, 2, 6, 14)$[cite: 68, 70]. (Normalized: $(\frac{2}{24}, \frac{2}{24}, \frac{6}{24}, \frac{14}{24})$).

## (d) Banzhaf Index
The calculated index is: $\frac{1}{8} \cdot (1, 1, 3, 5)$[cite: 69].

## (e) Veto Party
Yes. The **White Party** is a veto player because the grand coalition (all parties) would not meet the military quota of 21 without its 20 military MPs (the others sum to only 20)[cite: 69].
