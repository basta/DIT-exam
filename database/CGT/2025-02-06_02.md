# Question
(a) (2 pts) Is there an extensive-form game without chance moves that can be transformed into a normal-form game in such a way that some terminal rewards from the extensive-form game are missing?

(b) (5 pts) Consider a two-player zero-sum game with perfect recall and no chance moves. The longest trajectory has length $D$, and the infoset with the highest number of available actions contains $A$ actions. Describe the game structure and provide formulas for histories, terminal histories, and infosets for the minimum and maximum possible scenarios.

(c) (3 pts) Consider a modified zero-sum Matching Pennies:
1. Player 1 chooses the game type: Match or Don't Match.
2. Player 2 observes this and chooses Heads (H) or Tails (T).
3. Player 1 chooses H or T without observing Player 2's choice.
What are the variables in the linear program (Sequence Form) to find the Nash equilibrium for both players?

# Solution

## (a) Normal-Form Transformation
Yes, this can occur in games with **absent-mindedness** (where a player cannot distinguish between different nodes on the same path).

## (b) Complexity Analysis
* **Minimum Infosets:** Occurs when every node except the last has 1 action, and the last node has $A$ actions.
    * Histories: $|H| = D + A$.
    * Terminals: $|Z| = A$.
    * Infosets: $|I| = D$.
* **Maximum Infosets:** Occurs in a perfect information game where every node has $A$ actions.
    * Histories: $|H| = \sum_{i=0}^{D} A^i$.
    * Terminals: $|Z| = A^D$.
    * Infosets: $|I| = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} A^i$.

## (c) Linear Program Variables (Sequence Form)
* **Player 1 Variables:** Realization plans $r_1(\emptyset), r_1(M), r_1(N), r_1(MH), r_1(MT), r_1(NH), r_1(NT)$ and expected values for opponent's infosets $v_2(M), v_2(N)$.
* **Player 2 Variables:** Realization plans $r_2(\emptyset), r_2(MH), r_2(MT), r_2(NH), r_2(NT)$ and expected values for opponent's infosets $v_1(\emptyset), v_1(M), v_1(N)$.
