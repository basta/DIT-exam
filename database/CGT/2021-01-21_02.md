# Question
i) (4 pts) Three agents accept allocations $(2,1,0)$, $(0,3,0)$, or any convex combination. Find a three-player supermodular coalitional game where this set is the core. [cite: 601, 602]

ii) (4 pts) Alice, Bob, and Cecilia are creditors for two bankrupt companies. [cite: 604]
* **Company 1:** Estate = 100. Claims: Alice (200), Bob (50), Cecilia (100). [cite: 605, 606]
* **Company 2:** Estate = 200. Claims: Alice (50), Bob (150), Cecilia (50). [cite: 605, 606]
Describe bankruptcy games $v$ and $w$. How is the nucleolus of $v+w$ computed? [cite: 606, 607]

iii) (4 pts) Is the following game supermodular or superadditive? [cite: 608]
$v(1)=1, v(2)=2, v(3)=0, v(12)=3, v(13)=v(23)=1, v(123)=3$. [cite: 609]
Is the core nonempty? Describe it. [cite: 610]

iv) (8 pts) Shareholders own: 25, 16, 10, 49 shares. Approval requires $\ge 66$ votes. [cite: 611] Is it true that the shareholder with 10 shares has the same Banzhaf index as the one with 16? [cite: 611, 612]

# Solution

## i) Core and Supermodularity
The core of a supermodular game is the convex hull of its marginal vectors. [cite: 602] To find a game where the core is the segment between $(2,1,0)$ and $(0,3,0)$, we set $v(N)=3$ and define $v(S)$ such that these points satisfy the efficiency and stability constraints. [cite: 601, 602]

## ii) Bankruptcy Games
The bankruptcy game $v(S)$ is typically defined as $\max(0, E - \sum_{i \notin S} c_i)$, where $E$ is the estate and $c$ are claims. [cite: 606]
* **Game $v$ (Company 1):** Alice, Bob, and Cecilia are players. Alice's claim alone exceeds the estate. [cite: 605, 606]
* **Game $w$ (Company 2):** Bob has the largest claim. [cite: 606]
The nucleolus of the sum game $v+w$ is found by lexicographically minimizing the vector of excesses for all coalitions. [cite: 607]

## iii) Game Properties Analysis
* **Superadditivity:** A game is superadditive if $v(S \cup T) \ge v(S) + v(T)$ for disjoint $S, T$. [cite: 608] Here, $v(1)+v(3) = 1+0 = 1 = v(13)$ and $v(2)+v(3) = 2+0 = 2 > v(23)=1$. The game is **not** superadditive, and thus **not** supermodular. [cite: 608, 609]
* **Core:** The core is defined by $x_1+x_2+x_3=3, x_1 \ge 1, x_2 \ge 2, x_3 \ge 0$. Adding $x_1 \ge 1$ and $x_2 \ge 2$ already gives 3, so $x_3$ must be 0. The only allocation is **$(1, 2, 0)$**. [cite: 610]

## iv) Banzhaf Index Comparison
Winning coalitions ($\sum w_i \ge 66$):
* {49, 25}, {49, 16, 10}, {49, 25, 16}, {49, 25, 10}, {49, 25, 16, 10}.
Critical swings:
* **For 16:** In {49, 16, 10} and {49, 16, 25}.
* **For 10:** In {49, 10, 16} and {49, 10, 25}.
If they are involved in the same number of critical swings, their Banzhaf indices are identical. [cite: 611, 612]
