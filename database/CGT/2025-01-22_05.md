# Question
Two bidders, A and B. Valuations: $A \sim U[0, 1]$, $B \sim U[0, 2]$. [cite: 161, 162]

(a) (4 pts) If $A$'s value is 0.6, find the smallest valuation for $B$ to win. [cite: 163, 164]

(b) (1 pts) Is this auction efficient? Explain. [cite: 165]

# Solution

## (a) Winning Valuation
1.  **Reserve Prices:** Calculated as roots of the marginal revenue function $\phi(x) = x - \frac{1-F(x)}{f(x)}$[cite: 167].
2.  **Marginal Revenue Functions:**
    * $\phi_A(x) = 2x - 1$[cite: 168].
    * $\phi_B(x) = 2x - 2$[cite: 168].
3.  **Comparison:** The winner has the largest marginal revenue above their reserve price.
    * $\phi_A(0.6) = 2(0.6) - 1 = 0.2$.
    * To win, $B$ needs $\phi_B(x) > 0.2 \Rightarrow 2x - 2 > 0.2 \Rightarrow 2x > 2.2 \Rightarrow x > 1.1$[cite: 169].
**Result:** $B$ needs a valuation above 1.1[cite: 169].

## (b) Efficiency
No[cite: 173]. Optimal auctions (revenue-maximizing) are necessarily inefficient because they prioritize revenue over social utility maximization[cite: 174].
