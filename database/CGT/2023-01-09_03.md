# Question
Assuming risk-neutral bidders with independent private valuations on $[0,1]$: [cite: 374]

(a) (2 pts) Which mechanisms are strategically equivalent: i) Dutch, ii) First-price, iii) Second-price, iv) Japanese, v) English? [cite: 375]

(b) (2 pts) Which mechanisms are revenue equivalent: i) Dutch, ii) First-price, iii) Second-price, iv) Second-price with reserve, v) English, vi) Japanese? [cite: 376, 377]

# Solution

## (a) Strategic Equivalence
* **Pair 1:** Dutch and First-price sealed bid auctions. [cite: 379]
* **Pair 2:** Second-price sealed bid, Japanese, and English auctions. [cite: 379]

## (b) Revenue Equivalence
All listed mechanisms are revenue equivalent **except** for the Second-price sealed bid with a reserve price, which produces higher expected revenue. [cite: 383]
