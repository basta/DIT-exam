# Question
(a) (2 pts) Is it possible to transform a simultaneous-move game where all players choose their actions at the same time and the game may last for multiple rounds (e.g., Repeated Rock-Paper-Scissors) into an equivalent extensive-form game represented as a tree where players make decisions sequentially? If yes, describe the method; if not, explain why.

(b) (5 pts) Imagine a two-player card game where both players start with $N$ cards each. In each turn, a player secretly plays one of their cards and removes it from their hand without showing it to the other player. The game starts with Player 1, and the acting player alternates. Players don't draw new cards. The game ends when neither player has cards left. What is the total number of possible histories, terminal histories, and infosets for each player?

(c) (3 pts) In a two-player game, each player chooses an action: 1, 2, or 3. Nature randomly selects a number between 2 and 5 (equally likely). Players aim for the sum of their actions to match Nature's number. Player 1 observes Nature's number and acts. Player 2 does not know Nature's number but sees Player 1's action. Write down all possible sequences of play and list the pure strategies for Player 2.

# Solution

## (a) Transformation to Extensive-Form
Yes, it can be transformed. Each round of the simultaneous-move game is split into $n$ sequential rounds in the extensive form ($n$ = number of players). In each of these sub-rounds, only one player acts without revealing their choice to opponents (modeled using information sets). The order of players within this split does not matter.

## (b) Game Complexity Analysis
[Image of a game tree showing alternating turns and information sets]
- **Histories ($|H|$):** The game begins with 1 history. After Player 1 acts ($N$ actions) and Player 2 acts ($N$ actions), there are $N^2$ histories. This repeats with $N-1$ cards, then $N-2$, etc..
  Total histories: $|H| = 1 + \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \left( \prod_{j=0}^{i}(N-j)^2 + \prod_{j=0}^{i}(N-j) \cdot \prod_{j=0}^{i-1}(N-j) \right)$.
- **Terminal Histories ($|Z|$):** These occur when all cards are played: $|Z| = (N!)^2$.
- **Information Sets ($|I|$):** Since no information is revealed, the number of information sets equals the number of action sequences for each player: $|I| = 1 + \sum_{i=0}^{N} \prod_{j=0}^{i}(N-j)$.

## (c) Sequences and Strategies
- **Sequences ($\Sigma_2$):** $\Sigma_2 = \{\emptyset\} \cup \{A_i A_j \mid i, j \in \{1, 2, 3\}\}$.
- **Pure Strategies ($S_2$):** Since Player 2 reacts to Player 1's action ($A_1, A_2, A_3$), a pure strategy maps each of these 3 actions to one of 3 choices: $S_2 = \{A_1 A_i A_2 A_j A_3 A_k \mid i, j, k \in \{1, 2, 3\}\}$ (Total $3^3 = 27$ strategies).
