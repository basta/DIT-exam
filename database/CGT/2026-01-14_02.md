# Question
(a) (2 pts) Can a simultaneous-move game lasting multiple rounds be represented as an extensive-form game without changing strategic possibilities? Describe the construction. [cite: 261, 262, 263]

(b) (5 pts) Two players start with $N$ distinct cards. Nature flips a coin to decide who moves first. Players alternate turns playing cards secretly. No new cards are drawn. Compute: (i) total histories (decision nodes), (ii) terminal histories, (iii) information sets for each player. [cite: 267, 268, 269, 270, 271]

(c) (3 pts) Nature draws $T$ uniformly from $\{3, 4, 5, 6\}$. Each player chooses an action from $\{1, 2, 3\}$. Player 1 observes $T$; Player 2 only observes Player 1's action. Write the set of terminal histories and list Player 2's pure strategies. [cite: 272, 273, 274]

# Solution

## (a) Representation Construction
Yes. Each simultaneous stage is represented by fixing an arbitrary order of moves. [cite: 276] Later movers' decision nodes are placed in information sets that prevent them from observing earlier choices within that round. [cite: 276] This yields an extensive-form representation with imperfect information but identical strategic possibilities. [cite: 277]

## (b) Game Complexity Analysis
Let $p(N, t) := \frac{N!}{(N-t)!}$ be the number of length-$t$ sequences of distinct cards. [cite: 278]
- **Terminal Histories:** $2(N!)^2$ (accounting for the initial coin flip). [cite: 282]
- **Total Histories:** $1 + 2c$, where $c = 1 + \sum_{t=1}^{N} [p(N, t) \cdot p(N, t-1) + p(N, t)^2]$. [cite: 281, 282]
- **Information Sets:** Since moves are never revealed, information is characterized by the player's own past actions and the public coin flip. [cite: 282] Each player has $2 \sum_{t=0}^{N} p(N, t)$ information sets. [cite: 284]


## (c) Terminal Histories and Strategies
- **Terminal Histories:** $(T, a_1, a_2)$ where $T \in \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$ and $a_1, a_2 \in \{1, 2, 3\}$. [cite: 285]
- **Player 2 Pure Strategies:** Mappings $s_2: \{1, 2, 3\} \to \{1, 2, 3\}$. [cite: 285] There are $3^3 = 27$ pure strategies. [cite: 285]
