# Question
Company 1 decides to Enter or Stay Out. [cite: 384] Company 2 (already in market) decides simultaneously whether to Fight. [cite: 385] Company 2 is "normal" (prob $p$) or "aggressive" (prob $1-p$). [cite: 386]


(a) Best strategy for Company 2 based on $p$? [cite: 414]
(b) Best strategy for Company 1 based on $p$? [cite: 415]
(c) Company 1's expected payoff based on $p$? [cite: 416, 417]
(d) What is the pure Bayes-Nash equilibrium? [cite: 418]

# Solution

## (a) Company 2 Best Strategy
Company 2's strategy depends only on its type: [cite: 421]
* **Normal Type:** Not Fight. [cite: 420]
* **Aggressive Type:** Fight. [cite: 420]
It does **not** depend on $p$. [cite: 421]

## (b) Company 1 Best Strategy
Depends on $p$: [cite: 422]
* If $p > \frac{1}{2}$: **Enter**. [cite: 422]
* If $p < \frac{1}{2}$: **Stay Out**. [cite: 423]
* If $p = \frac{1}{2}$: Any mixture is a best response. [cite: 423, 427]

## (c) Expected Payoff (Company 1)
* If $p > \frac{1}{2}$: Payoff is $2p - 1$. [cite: 425, 428]
* If $p \le \frac{1}{2}$: Payoff is $0$. [cite: 425]

## (d) Pure Bayes-Nash Equilibrium
* **Case $p > \frac{1}{2}$:** (Enter; Normal: Not Fight, Aggressive: Fight). [cite: 429]
* **Case $p < \frac{1}{2}$:** (Stay Out; Normal: Not Fight, Aggressive: Fight). [cite: 430]
* **Case $p = \frac{1}{2}$:** (Any mixture; Normal: Not Fight, Aggressive: Fight). [cite: 431]
