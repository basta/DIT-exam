# Question
(5 pts) Consider a VCG auction with three bidders $\{a, b, c\}$ and two goods $\{g_1, g_2\}$. Valuations: [cite: 544, 550]
| Bundle | $\{g_1\}$ | $\{g_2\}$ | $\{g_1, g_2\}$ |
|---|---|---|---|
| $v_a$ | 2 | 1 | 6 |
| $v_b$ | 2 | 4 | 4 |
| $v_c$ | 3 | 2 | 5 |

1. What bids are placed? [cite: 545]
2. What is the allocation? [cite: 546]
3. What are the payments? [cite: 547]
4. Is the allocation efficient? [cite: 552]
5. Is it revenue maximizing? [cite: 553]

# Solution
1. **Bids:** In VCG, agents bid their true valuations for all bundles. [cite: 555]
2. **Allocation:** Bidder **b** receives $g_2$ and Bidder **c** receives $g_1$. (Bidder **a** gets nothing). [cite: 556]
3. **Payments:** Bidder **b** pays 3; Bidder **c** pays 2. (Bidder **a** pays 0). [cite: 557]
4. **Efficiency:** **Yes.** VCG is efficient because it maximizes social welfare (sum of utilities). [cite: 558, 559]
5. **Revenue Maximizing:** **No.** VCG is not designed for revenue maximization; expected revenue could be increased via reserve prices. [cite: 560]
