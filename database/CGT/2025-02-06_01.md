# Question
(10p) Consider a two-player game where the payoffs of the players are given by:

| | a | b | c |
|---|---|---|---|
| **d** | 3, 3 | 5, 1 | 2, 4 |
| **e** | 1, 5 | 4, 4 | 3, 2 |
| **f** | 4, 2 | 2, 3 | 1, 1 |

(a) (2 pts) Does every player have a pure strategy which weakly or strongly dominates every other strategy?

(b) (2 pts) Does the game have a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies?

(c) (3 pts) Consider the mixed strategies $p(d) = p(f) = 0.5$ for Player 1 and $q(a) = q(c) = 0.5$ for Player 2. Is $(p, q)$ a mixed Nash equilibrium?

(d) (3 pts) Assume every player uses a uniform distribution as a mixed strategy. Is such a pair a mixed Nash equilibrium?

# Solution

## (a) Dominant Strategies
No. By enumerating all strategies for each player, it can be verified that no strategy is dominant (neither weakly nor strongly) for either player.

## (b) Pure Nash Equilibrium
No. An enumeration of all 9 strategy profiles shows that there is no profile where both players are playing a best response to each other.

## (c) Mixed Nash Equilibrium Verification
**Yes.** * **Player 1 Utility:** $U_1(p, q) = 2.5$. Calculating utilities for pure strategies against $q$: $U_1(d, q) = 2.5$, $U_1(f, q) = 2.5$, and $U_1(e, q) = 2$. Since $U_1(d, q) = U_1(f, q) > U_1(e, q)$, $p$ is a best response.
* **Player 2 Utility:** $U_2(p, q) = 2.5$. Calculating utilities for pure strategies against $p$: $U_2(p, a) = 2.5$, $U_2(p, c) = 2.5$, and $U_2(p, b) = 2$. Since $U_2(p, a) = U_2(p, c) > U_2(p, b)$, $q$ is a best response.

## (d) Uniform Mixed Strategies
No. Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be uniform distributions ($1/3$ for each strategy). 
* $U_1(r_1, r_2) = \frac{25}{9} \approx 2.78$. 
* However, if Player 1 deviates to strategy $d$, the payoff is $U_1(d, r_2) = \frac{3+5+2}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33$.
Since Player 1 can improve their payoff by deviating, the uniform profile is not a Nash equilibrium.
