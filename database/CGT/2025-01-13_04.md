# Question
(5 pts) Find the unique mixed Bayesian Nash equilibrium and associated payoffs for this game:
Players $a_1$ and $a_2$. $a_2$ has two types, $a_2^l$ and $a_2^r$ (each 50% likely), and actions L, R[cite: 71, 72]. $a_1$ has one type and actions U, D[cite: 72].

**Payoffs ($a_2^l$ - Left type):**
| | L | R |
|---|---|---|
| **U** | 3, 3 | 1, 4 |
| **D** | 1, 4 | 3, 3 |

**Payoffs ($a_2^r$ - Right type):**
| | L | R |
|---|---|---|
| **U** | 1, 3 | 0, 4 |
| **D** | 1, 2 | 1, 3 |

# Solution

In a Bayesian NE, $a_1$ plays a strategy against the expected behavior of both types of $a_2$.
- For $a_2^r$, action R is a dominant strategy (payoff 4 vs 3 if $a_1$ plays U; payoff 3 vs 2 if $a_1$ plays D)[cite: 77, 80].
- For $a_2^l$, there is no dominant strategy. Let $a_1$ play U with probability $p$. $a_2^l$ chooses between L and R.

Based on the provided solution[cite: 80]:
- **$a_2$ Strategy:** Type $a_2^l$ plays mixed strategy $[\frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{4}]$ (L with $0.75$), and type $a_2^r$ plays $[0, 1]$ (pure R)[cite: 80].
- **$a_1$ Strategy:** $a_1$ chooses actions to make $a_2^l$ indifferent or maximize expected utility[cite: 81].
