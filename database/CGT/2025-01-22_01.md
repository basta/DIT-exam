# Question
(10p) Consider a two-player zero-sum game where the utility of the row player is given by the matrix
$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & -2 & 1 \\ 1 & 4 & 0 \\ -1 & 2 & 5 \end{bmatrix}$$

(a) (2 pts) Does the game have a pure strategy Nash equilibrium?

(b) (2 pts) Compute $\max_i \min_j A_{ij}$ and $\min_j \max_i A_{ij}$ and interpret them from the game-theoretic perspective.

(c) (2 pts) Formulate a linear program for computing the value of this game.

(d) (2 pts) Without solving the linear program in (c), find the lower and upper bound on the value of the game.

(e) (2 pts) Let $q$ be a uniform probability distribution on 3 pure strategies. Is the strategy profile $(q, q)$ a Nash equilibrium?

# Solution

## (a) Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium
No, the game does not have a pure strategy Nash equilibrium because the matrix has no saddle point.

## (b) Maximin and Minimax Values
* $\max_i \min_j A_{ij} = 0$.
* $\min_j \max_i A_{ij} = 3$.
* **Interpretation:** The former ($\max \min$) is the lower bound on the utility of the row player, while the latter ($\min \max$) is the upper bound on the loss of the column player.

## (c) Linear Program Formulation
Maximize $v$ subject to:
* $3p_1 + p_2 - p_3 \ge v$
* $-2p_1 + 4p_2 + 2p_3 \ge v$
* $p_1 + 5p_3 \ge v$
* $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$
* $p_1, p_2, p_3 \ge 0, \quad v \in \mathbb{R}$

## (d) Bounds on Game Value
Using the results from (b), the value of the game $v$ must be within the bounds $0 \le v \le 3$.

## (e) Uniform Strategy Equilibrium Check
No. Plugging the uniform distribution $q$ into the primal LP yields $v=1$, but the dual LP (for the column player) yields an optimal value $v' = 2$. Since these values do not coincide, it is not an equilibrium.
