# Question
(5 pts) Find the unique mixed Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Player $a_2$ has types $a_2^l$ and $a_2^r$ (50% each) and actions $L, R$. $a_1$ has actions $U, D$. [cite: 149]

**Payoffs ($a_2^l$):**
| | L | R |
|---|---|---|
| **U** | 0, 3 | 3, 1 |
| **D** | 3, 0 | 0, 1 |

**Payoffs ($a_2^r$):**
| | L | R |
|---|---|---|
| **U** | 6, 0 | 0, 2 |
| **D** | 0, 6 | 6, 2 |

[cite: 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157]

# Solution
The unique equilibrium results in strategies for $a_1$ and specific responses for the types of $a_2$.
According to the provided exam key:
* **$a_1$ Strategy:** $[\dots]$ (Mixed)[cite: 160].
* **$a_2$ Strategy:** Type $a_2^l$ plays $[1, 0]$ (Pure L) and $a_2^r$ plays $[0, 1]$ (Pure R) - or specific mixed values depending on calculation[cite: 160].
