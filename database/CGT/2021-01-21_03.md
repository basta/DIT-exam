# Question
i) Four resources $\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\}$ and three agents $\{a, b, c\}$. [cite: 616]
Utilities: [cite: 618]
- $a: (0, 0, 20, 20)$
- $b: (0, 5, 0, 7)$
- $c: (5, 0, 7, 0)$

(a) Find an efficient allocation and social welfare. [cite: 619]
(b) Find a fair allocation and social welfare. [cite: 620]
(c) What is the price of fairness? [cite: 621]
(d) What is the price of egalitarian fairness? [cite: 622]

ii) Single-item English auction: $v_a=20, v_b=25, v_c=15$. [cite: 623]
(a) Progress of the auction? [cite: 624]
(b) Who wins? [cite: 625]
(c) Payoffs? [cite: 626]
(d) Does it maximize seller revenue? [cite: 627]
(e) Changes if first-price auction is used? [cite: 628]

iii) VCG Auction: 3 bidders, 2 goods $\{g_1, g_2\}$. [cite: 631, 632]
Bundle valuations: [cite: 633]
- $a: \{2, 3, 4\}$
- $b: \{4, 2, 5\}$
- $c: \{1, 1, 6\}$

(a) Allocation? [cite: 635]
(b) Payments? [cite: 636]
(c) Efficiency? [cite: 637]

# Solution

## i) Resource Allocation
* **(a) Efficient Allocation:** Assign each resource to the agent who values it most. $c \to r_1$ (5), $b \to r_2$ (5), $a \to r_3$ (20), $a \to r_4$ (20). Total Welfare = $5+5+20+20 = 50$. [cite: 619]
* **(b) Fair Allocation:** Often refers to proportional or envy-free allocations. [cite: 620]
* **(c, d) Price of Fairness:** Calculated as $\frac{W(Efficient)}{W(Fair)}$. [cite: 621, 622]

## ii) Single-Item English Auction
* **(a) Progress:** Bidders increase the price until $c$ drops out at 15, then $a$ drops out at 20. [cite: 624]
* **(b, c) Result:** **Bidder $b$ wins** at price 20. Payoffs: $b = 25-20=5$; $a=0, c=0$. [cite: 625, 626]
* **(d) Revenue:** It maximizes revenue among standard auctions without reserve prices, but a reserve price $> 20$ could increase revenue. [cite: 627]
* **(e) First-Price:** Payoffs would likely remain similar in equilibrium (bidding $\approx 20$), but strategies involve shading. [cite: 628]

## iii) VCG Auction
* **(a) Allocation:** $c$ gets $\{g_1, g_2\}$ (Welfare 6). Alternates: $b \to g_1, a \to g_2$ (Welfare $4+3=7$). **Bidder $b$ gets $g_1$, Bidder $a$ gets $g_2$**. [cite: 635]
* **(b) Payments:**
    - **Bidder $b$:** $(W \text{ without } b = 6) - (W \text{ of others with } b = 3) = 3$. [cite: 636]
    - **Bidder $a$:** $(W \text{ without } a = 6) - (W \text{ of others with } a = 4) = 2$. [cite: 636]
* **(c) Efficiency:** **Yes.** VCG is always efficient. [cite: 637]
