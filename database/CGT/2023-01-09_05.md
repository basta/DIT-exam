# Question
Winning coalitions: $\{1,2,3\}$, $\{1,2,4\}$, $\{2,3,4\}$, $\{1,2,3,4\}$. [cite: 435]

(a) (1 pts) Is this a weighted voting game? [cite: 436]
(b) (2 pts) Identify vetoers, dictators, and null players. [cite: 437]
(c) (3 pts) Compute Banzhaf indices. [cite: 438]
(d) (2 pts) Is the core nonempty? [cite: 439]
(e) (2 pts) Is the game supermodular or superadditive? [cite: 440]

# Solution

## (a) Weighted Representation
**Yes.** [cite: 442] One possible representation is weights $w = (1, 2, 1, 1)$ with quota $q = 4$. [cite: 442]

## (b) Player Roles
* **Vetoer:** Player 2. [cite: 442]
* **Dictators:** None. [cite: 442]
* **Null Players:** None (every player can turn some losing coalition into a winning one). [cite: 442]

## (c) Banzhaf Index
The Banzhaf index vector is $(\frac{2}{8}, \frac{4}{8}, \frac{2}{8}, \frac{2}{8})$. [cite: 443] (Note: source text shows fractions slightly differently, but calculation for player 2 is $4/8$). [cite: 443]

## (d) Core
**Nonempty.** [cite: 443] A core allocation is $(0, 1, 0, 0)$, as Player 2 is a vetoer. [cite: 443]

## (e) Game Properties
* **Not Supermodular:** $v(123) + v(124) > v(1234) + v(12)$ (since $1 + 1 > 1 + 0$). [cite: 445]
* **Superadditive:** Yes, because there are no two disjoint winning coalitions. [cite: 446]
